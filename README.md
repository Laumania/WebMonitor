# WebMonitor
The main purpose of the WebMonitor application, is to be able to have an easy and simpel way to monitor your server/host through HTTP. You run the application from your desktop and get notifications if on of you monitors act abnormal. This can mean a ruled has failed, ex. you have set the monitor of CodePlex.com to have an MaxResponse time to 500 ms. If the reponse time exceeds this value, an balloonTip will show you that something is up.

All comments and issue reporting is very welcome. Hope you enjoy the application.
